-- | The PagerDuty event integration API is how you would add PagerDuty's
-- advanced alerting functionality to any system that can make an HTTP API
-- call. You can now add phone, SMS and email alerting to your monitoring
-- tools, ticketing systems and custom software.
--
-- The API was designed to allow you to easily integrate a
-- monitoring system with a Service in PagerDuty. Monitoring systems
-- generally send out events when problems are detected and when these
-- problems have been resolved (fixed). Some more advanced systems also
-- understand the concept of acknowledgements: problems can be acknowledged
-- by an engineer to signal he or she is working on fixing the issue.
--
-- Since monitoring systems emit events, the API is based around accepting
-- events. Incoming events (sent via the API) are routed to a PagerDuty
-- service and processed. They may result in a new incident being created,
-- or an existing incident being acknowledged or resolved.
--
-- The same event-based API can also be used to integrate a PagerDuty
-- service with ticketing systems and various other software tools.
