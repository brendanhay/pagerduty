-- | This API lets you access and manipulate the services across your account.
--
-- A service is an endpoint (like Nagios, email, or an API call) that
-- generates events, which Pagerduty normalizes and dedupes, creating incidents.
--
-- When a service is shown inlined in other resources, a deleted service will
-- have its @html_url@ attribute set to 'Nothing'.
