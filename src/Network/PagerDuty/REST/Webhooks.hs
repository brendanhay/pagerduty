-- | Webhooks let you recieve HTTP callbacks when interesting events happen within
-- your PagerDuty account. Details surrounding the interesting event will be sent
-- via HTTP to a URL that you specify.
--
-- PagerDuty currently supports incident-based webhooks. After adding a webhook
-- URL to a PagerDuty service, the triggering of new incidents on that service
-- will cause outgoing webhook messages to be sent to that URL. In addition,
-- certain interesting changes to an incident's state will cause other types of
-- incident webhook messages to be sent: Generally, any change to the @status@ or
-- @assigned_to_user@ of an incident will cause an outgoing message to be sent.
