-- | PagerDuty keeps a log of all the events that happen to an incident. The
-- following APIs provide fine-grained access to this incident log entry data to
-- give you more insight into how your team or organization is handling your
-- incidents. Log entry data includes details about the event(s) that triggered
-- the incident, who was notified and when, how they were notified, and who
-- acknowledged or resolved it, amongst a few other things.
